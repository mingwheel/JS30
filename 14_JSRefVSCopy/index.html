      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team); // Same
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      //* team is a reference to players
      //* so players gets updated too
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "Lux";
      //* players doesn't change
      // or
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      // ES6
      const team4 = [...players];

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };
      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      //* person.number = 99 too.
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      //* assign args: take blank obj, fold in props from (person) obj, add in own props
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
      // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      // Using JSON.parse and JSON.stringify to copy deeper than 1 level
      const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
